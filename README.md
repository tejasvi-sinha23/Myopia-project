# Myopia-Project - Eye Myopia Detection using Quantum-Classical Hybrid Model

This project integrates a **Quantum-Classical Hybrid Model** to detect **myopia** in eye images. The backend uses **Flask** to handle image classification, while the frontend is built using **React** to provide an interactive user interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Myopia-Project** leverages both **quantum computing** and **classical machine learning** to classify eye images as **Normal** or **Myopic**. The goal of this project is to explore the potential of quantum computing in medical image classification while providing a practical solution for detecting eye conditions using a hybrid approach.

### 🔹 **Key Components**

1. **Backend (Flask API)**: 
   - The backend runs a **quantum-classical hybrid model** using **PyTorch** and **PennyLane**.
   - The model classifies images of eyes into **Normal** and **Myopic** categories.
   - A REST API built with **Flask** is used to serve the model and handle prediction requests.

2. **Frontend (React UI)**: 
   - The frontend is built using **React** and allows users to upload an image of an eye to the backend for prediction.
   - The prediction (Normal or Myopic) is displayed along with the confidence score.

3. **Machine Learning Model**: 
   - The model combines **quantum circuits** using PennyLane for data encoding and entanglement, with a **classical neural network** for decision-making.
   - The model was trained on a dataset of eye images to detect myopia and achieved an accuracy of around **90%**.

##### 🧠 Model Explanation
The quantum-classical hybrid model used in this project leverages Quantum Computing to encode the image data into quantum states. The quantum layer then applies quantum circuits using PennyLane for entanglement, followed by a classical neural network for the final classification (Normal vs. Myopic).

The Flask API serves the trained model, which was trained on a dataset of eye images to predict whether an eye is Normal or Myopic. The React UI allows users to upload eye images and receive predictions based on the trained model.

#### 🏆 Model Accuracy
The hybrid model achieved a 90% accuracy on the dataset during training. The model combines the strengths of classical and quantum methods to provide a robust solution for medical image classification.
